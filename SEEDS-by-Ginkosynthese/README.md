Unofficial version based on the open source code released by Ginkosynthese for SEEDS. I've modified the code and schematic to add a switch to choose between gated and triggered modes. Triggered mode jumps straight to the decay envelope after the rising edge of the Gate pulse, to create a percussive sound.
