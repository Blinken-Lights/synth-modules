Meter is a MIDI sequencer designed as a Eurorack module.
It can also run off USB power via the plug on the Nano - in which case the 7805 regulator and Eurorack power header can be omitted.

The schematic MIDI plugs are designed to use MIDI to TRS cables. It could be adapted to use standard MIDI connectors instead.
