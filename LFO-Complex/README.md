The schematic shows an analogue LFO sub-assembly with bias and attenuation controls. Several of these sub-assemblies can be chained together, which can create increasingly complex waveforms.

The LFO circuit is based on a fairly common circuit seen in various places on the internet. This is just a version that includes all my favourite features and enables the built-in ability to bias, attenuate and chain each circuit.
